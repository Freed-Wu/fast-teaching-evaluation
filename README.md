# fastTeachingEvaluation
It can help you evaluate teaching half-automatically. Only tested in my school system. Note: I will not bear any consequences arising from the abuse of this procedure.

p.s. The script is very easy. Even though your school is not as same as mine, I think you can write a script for your school system by yourself.
